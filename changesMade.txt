16/3 - 23/3
    ROBOT: Changed the equations for stopping and progressing on the path to rules.
        Implemented operation maxTimeIncrease
    LOCATION: implemented operation to calculate distance between two locations.
    TIMED FARM: implemented operation maxTimeIncrease and maxTimeIncreaseGlobal to find the maximum time the configuration is allowed to progress.

24/5
    PATHFINDER: Implemented pathfinding by Dijkstra's algorithm. To use it, a set of connected intersections, an intersection representing start and an
    intersection representing goal is passed in.
